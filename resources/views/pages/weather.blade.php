                                                main hub that all of the data is pulled from for the ESP32. The main draw of this portion is that this will get the 
                                                location of your ESP32 system and will link it with the proper GPS location for the ESP32 allowing you to look at 
                                                current weather, and forcasts for your system that is sitting on your desk!
