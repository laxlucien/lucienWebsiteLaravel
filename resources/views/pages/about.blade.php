                        Lucien Lee grew up in Boise Idaho, and attended High School at 
                        Bishop Kelly High School. He then went on to study computer science 
                        at The University of Idaho. Lucien will be graduating in Spring of 2024 and 
                        can't wait to apply all of the different skills he has learned over the years 
                        to industry.

                        Lucien always liked to have his 
                        foot in many different parts of everything. Since he was never able 
                        to decide on one thing to focus all of his time on, he created this website.
                        With this website, he and his friends are able to display anything that they
                        feel is right with the public at any time, from any place.

                        I hope you enjoy viewing and using this website just as much as 
                        I enjoyed creating it. If you would like to contribute to this website,
